					<p>As far back as I can remember I’ve been in the kitchen…<br><br>From donning my mother’s green apron to bake gooey, double-fudge brownies for the school bake-sale, to helping my grandmother whip up a sumptuous holiday feast, to putting together my very first layer-cake in the fourth grade-I was never happier than when I was using my hands to create something beautiful and delicious (except for maybe when I was eating it!).<br><br>After earning a degree in Literature from New York University, I got the chance to pursue my life’s dream and attended the Culinary Institute of America, specializing in Baking and Pastry Arts. After graduation, I spent the next few years learning the unique art of making wedding and special occasion cakes at one of Manhattan’s premier cake boutiques before moving on to develop my own artistic vision at Sweet Melissa Patisserie in Brooklyn, NY.<br><br>I have experience working in busy restaurant pastry kitchens, full-scale production bakeries and catering halls, but my true passion lies in creating scrumptious and stunning cakes. (I’ve been hooked since I licked cake batter off my first beater!)<br><br>In 2009, I opened Love Street Cakes. My designs are modern, graphic, and one-of-a-kind. I focus on textures and tones to create something distinctly elegant and personally suited to each client and occasion.<br><br>Not a lot has changed since I was that little girl in my mother’s apron, except now I have an apron of my own!</p>
